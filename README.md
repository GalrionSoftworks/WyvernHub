# WyvernHub: Mod Manager
WyvernHub aims to offer a solution to managing mods for PAYDAY 2 & PAYDAY 3. I have plans to allow for the import of .ZIP, .RAR, and other files into the editor with automatic installation. I hope to assist players in setting up mods for these games, and if possible, integrate API access for download and update of mods from ModWorkshop and NexusMods.
